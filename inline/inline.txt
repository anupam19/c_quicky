If you are writing a header file to be included in ISO C89 programs, write __inline__ instead of inline

To inline is to remove the function call and place it's contents directly where the call would be made.
This often removes the overhead of calling a function.
It is not always optimal, because of code bloat (code getting too big and not fitting into cache),
so most compilers will ignore all inline directives and do what they feel is best.
